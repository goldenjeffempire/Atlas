Build a modern, interactive, and visually appealing Workspace Booking App called ATLAS, inspired by apps like Skedda, Archie, and Tactic. The app should be responsive, professional, and optimized for performance and UX. It must be implemented using Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components. Use Framer Motion for animations and transitions.
