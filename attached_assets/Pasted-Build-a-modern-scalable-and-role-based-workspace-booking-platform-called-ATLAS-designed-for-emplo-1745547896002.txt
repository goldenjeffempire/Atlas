Build a modern, scalable, and role-based workspace booking platform called ATLAS, designed for employees, admins, and general users across multiple organizations and locations.

The platform should support physical space bookings (like desks and meeting rooms) and virtual conferencing (Zoom/Meet/Teams). It must be visually appealing, animated, mobile-friendly, and accessible — built using Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Framer Motion.

Include persistent live chat support on every page, powerful admin analytics, and full multi-location + multi-organization support.
